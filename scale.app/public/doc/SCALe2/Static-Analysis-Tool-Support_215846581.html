                    <p>The intent of this document is to provide an overview of the static analysis tools supported by SCALe. The goal is not to explain the gory details of running each tool. Rather, the goal is to describe how each tool is connected to SCALe. For in-depth tool usage information, refer to your tool-specific documentation.</p><h2 id="StaticAnalysisToolSupport-StaticAnalysisToolIntegration">Static Analysis Tool Integration</h2><p>SCALe models external static analysis tools in a simple fashion. A tool is seen as a collection of <strong>checkers</strong>, entities that detect certain phenomena in a program. For example, a checker might detect null pointer dereferences in a C program. The list of checkers for a given static analysis tool is determined by studying the documentation for the tool and running the tool on reference code bases. Every checker is assigned a unique name within SCALe and is associated with a CERT Secure Coding rule, such that behavior detected by the checker constitutes possible violation of this rule. A specific instance of behavior detected by a checker is called a <strong>diagnostic</strong>.</p><p>Each static analysis tool has its own output format. The SCALe software includes scripts for translating various tool outputs into a common format. However, this translation process has some constraints. SCALe is not guaranteed to support every output format for every version of every tool. In the following sections, we'll delineate these constraints, for each supported tool.</p><p> </p>
